# Netflix Movies and TV Shows Data Analysis
### About
---
The project aims to understand which movies and TV shows Netflix most frequently adds to the platform, which countries lead in content production, and how content changes over time.
This analysis could help streaming platforms, media researchers, and regular users understand Netflix's content preferences. The dataset was obtained from the [Kaggle Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download) .
"Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have over 8000 movies or tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 200M Subscribers globally. This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc." [source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)
### Purposes Of The Project
---
_The goal of the project is to analyze data from the Netflix data set to identify key patterns and trends, such as:_

- Distribution of films and series by genre and country,

- Analysis of content duration and ratings,

- Studying the dynamics of content release by year,

- Identifying popular categories and audience preferences.

### Analysis List
---
1. Content Type Analysis🎬
> Analyze the distribution between Movies and TV Shows. Determine which type is more dominant on the platform and how their proportions vary by country or over time.
2. Country & Regional Trends🌍
> Explore the geographical distribution of content. Identify which countries produce the most content, and what genres or types are popular in different regions.
3. Release & Addition Date Analysis📆
> Compare the release year of content vs. the year it was added to Netflix. Determine trends in how recent or old the content on Netflix tends to be.
4. Genre & Category Analysis⭐
> Investigate which genres (e.g., Drama, Comedy, Documentary) are most common. Identify which genres dominate movies vs. TV shows and how they have evolved over time.
5. Rating Distribution🔞
> Analyze the distribution of content ratings (e.g., TV-MA, PG, R). This can help understand the age-targeted strategy of Netflix in different regions or years.
6. Duration Analysis⏱️
> Study the length of movies and the number of seasons for TV shows. Understand average durations and find any outliers (very long or very short content).
7. Cast & Director Frequency🎭🎬
> Examine which actors and directors appear most frequently in Netflix content. This can help identify key figures or partnerships in Netflix's content strategy.

### Approach used
---
1. Data cleaning : 
This is the first step where inspection of data is done to make sure NULL values and missing values are detected and data replacement methods are used to replace, missing or NULL values.
> 1. Build a database(netflix_titles)
> 2. Create a table
> 3. Insert a data to this table
> 4. Finding a NULL values , filling them with N/A. Also search for duplicates(when deleting them I leave the very first ID)

2. Feature Engineering : Creating a new columns from existing.

> 1. Created a cte with columns `movie_count` , `tv_show_count` , `total_titles` :
This will help to understand how many lines are in movies and how many are in TV shows, for further analysis. Also join cte with main table `netflix_titles`
   
> 2. Created a new column named `duration_minutes`(including max duration,min duration, avg duration).
For Movies, this extracts the duration in minutes (e.g., "90 min" → 90). For TV Shows, a different logic is applied (e.g., "2 Seasons" is handled separately).
This helps analyze the average length of content on Netflix and understand typical viewing times. 

> 3. Created a new column named `content_category`:
Categorizes titles based on their listed genres (Action, Comedy, Documentary , etc.).
This helps group and analyze what types of content dominate Netflix’s library.

> 4. Combine `genres` and `rating` CTE's to create view
 This SQL view was created to analyze how different genres of content on Netflix are distributed across various age ratings. 

> 4. Actor/Director Splitting: The `cast` and ` director` fields were split into individual entries (`actors_split` and `director_split`), then combined into a unified column to analyze frequency and prominence of people involved in the content. A count of appearances was calculated to identify the most frequent actors and directors on the platform.

> 5. Extract `year` from from the `date_added` field:
These help analyze trends over time, like what years Netflix added the most content.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploratory data analysis is done to answer the listed questions and aims of this project.

4. Visualization : The visualization allows for a deeper understanding of the distribution of content by genre, ratings, type (movies/shows), duration, and the dynamics of new titles.

4. Conclusion:

> 1. Strong geographic concentration
The largest amount of content on the platform is from the US (≈2.5K), followed by India (1K) and the UK by a notable margin. This indicates the dominance of English and Indian content on Netflix.

> 2. The peak content additions are from 2018-2020
The Content Release Trend graph shows a sharp increase during this period, especially after 2016. This coincides with Netflix's global expansion and subscriber growth.

>  3. There are almost 2.3 times more movies than shows
Of the total 8,806 pieces of content:
- 6,130 are movies,
- 2,676 are TV series.
This confirms the platform's emphasis on movies, but also shows a significant presence of TV series.

>  4. Genre diversity - 19K mentions
Most popular genres:
- Dramas (14.5%),
- Comedies (13.4%),
- Documentaries (8.6%),

> 5. Action & Adventure (7.5%).
This reflects the preferences of a broad audience and Netflix's desire to cover both entertaining and educational genres.
Movies are on average 100 minutes in length
Range:
- Maximum - 312 min,
- Minimum - 3 minutes.
TV series are measured in seasons (1-17). This gives insight into typical viewing time and audience preferences.

> 6. Adult content prevails on the platform
Analysis by age ratings and genre shows that many movies are labeled TV-MA and R, targeting audiences over 16.

> 7. Recurring faces in production
Among the actors and directors, there are those who appear 20+ times, indicating Netflix's frequent collaboration with the same professionals (e.g. Anupam Kher - 43 appearances).
